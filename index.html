                            <p>I am a passionate and dedicated software developer with 2 years of experience in the
                                industry. My expertise lies in web development, where I have honed my skills in various
                                programming languages and frameworks. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and
                                JavaScript, which allows me to create responsive and interactive web applications. In
                                addition to these core technologies, I have extensive experience with Laravel and
                                Vue.js. Laravel has been my go to framework, for backend development, enabling me to
                                build robust and scalable server side applications. On the front end, Vue.js has been
                                instrumental in creating dynamic user interfaces and enhancing the overall user
                                experience. Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from
                                small websites to complex web applications. I am constantly learning and adapting to new
                                technologies to stay up to date with the latest trends in the industry.</p>
